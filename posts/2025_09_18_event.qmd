## About the Event
Transform your static R plots into interactive, engaging visual stories! In this hands-on workshop, we’ll take pre-organised ggplot2 code and show you how to enhance it with ggplotly, making your data come alive for presentations, dashboards, and reports.

Through practical case studies, you’ll explore a variety of visualisations, learn why certain methods are best for different data types, and see how interactive features can add depth and clarity to your insights.

Whether you prefer to follow along in R with the required packages installed or explore the concepts via Google Colab and copy the code once you get home, you’ll gain actionable tips to elevate your R visualisations—no matter your platform. By the end, you’ll be ready to make your data clickable, hoverable, and truly dynamic.

There’ll also be food, drinks, and plenty of time to network with fellow attendees!

## Speaker: Dr Kirsty McCann

Dr Kirsty McCann is an Associate Research Fellow working in malaria genomic epidemiology at Deakin University in Geelong. As a bioinformatician, Kirsty enjoys combining R coding, problem-solving, and infectious disease data analysis to answer a range of different research questions.

We look forward to seeing you there!
