This is the first entry on our R Ladies Melbourne website! 

The intention of this website is to hold a place for of our chapter's events, links, code, tutorials and so on, with the hopes that this will be a portal for members to continue to grow their skills and learn from each other.

Let us know via our [**email**](rladiesmelbourne@gmail.com) or [**github repo**](https://github.com/R-LadiesMelbourne) if there are any features you'd like to see or recommend! 

- Dionne on behalf of R Ladies Melbourne!
