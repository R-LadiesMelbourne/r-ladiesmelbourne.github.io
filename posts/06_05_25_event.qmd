## About the Event

R-Ladies Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney are thrilled to host our first ever cross-chapter TidyTuesday and we would love to have you come along!

TidyTuesday is a weekly event created by the Data Science Learning Community for folks to develop new skills in a low-stakes, welcoming environment. Each week, a new dataset is released for everyone to play and explore. There is no limit to what you can do! You can produce a nice-looking table, or a story-telling graphic, perhaps even an intuitive Shiny interface â€“ the choice is yours!

## What to expect

Join a follow-along group or work independently on the same dataset for about 30 mins then come together to celebrate each otherâ€™s creations!

Come join us for a fun session on coding with R and Rstudio! This event is online only. All you need is your laptop!

We look forward to seeing you there!

ðŸ’œ Dionne on behalf of R-Ladies Melbourne
