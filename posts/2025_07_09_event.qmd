## About the Event

Do you have trouble keeping track of changes in your code? Have you ever had to collaborate on a project with others and had to send files back and forth tediously? Git will be your best friend to solve these problems and many more!

This presentation will give you an introduction to Git, the basics of how to use it, and some of its very helpful applications such as collaboration and code reproducibility. The focus will be on the use of Git in conjunction with Github (yes, these are two separate things!). This will help you to effectively use one of the most powerful tools available to you and give you more confidence to code freely without fear.

There’ll also be food, drinks, and plenty of time to network with fellow attendees!

## Speaker: Felicia Bongiovanni

Felicia is a PhD candidate at The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research currently researching the immune response to several infectious diseases using mathematical modelling and code.

We look forward to seeing you there!
