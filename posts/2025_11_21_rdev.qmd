Last Friday, Dionne, Felicia, Harriet and Daidai from our committee had the chance to participate in R Dev Day organised by Dr Heather Turner, and what a fantastic experience it was! 🎉

We spent the day coding alongside fellow R enthusiasts, not only in person in Melbourne, but also joining forces with amazing participants in Brisbane, Perth, and even internationally. 🌏

It was inspiring to collaborate, share ideas, and contribute to the R community together. Events like this remind me how energising and supportive the open-source world can be.

It was especially exciting to see such a great turnout of R-Ladies+ from R-Ladies Melbourne Inc, R-Ladies Amsterdam and R-Ladies Global!

Already looking forward to the next one! 💜💻
