## About the Event

Under Heather's research software engineering fellowship "Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion) in the R Project", she has led the organisation of nine "R Dev Day"s, where R users work collaboratively on contributions to base R and to infrastructure that supports such contribution. Around 150 people have participated in these events, with good representation from groups that have historically been underrepresented in the contributor community, including women and gender minorities.

In this talk, Heather will give some insight into the tasks that people have worked on at R Dev Days, highlighting some examples that R-Ladies have been involved in. It's broader than you might think, including translation, dashboards, websites, the contributor guide, and CRAN utilities, as well as the code and documentation of base R. Heather will explain different ways to get involved, including joining the upcoming hybrid events at [Monash University](https://pretix.eu/r-contributors/r-dev-day-oz-25/) and the [University of Auckland](https://pretix.eu/r-contributors/r-dev-day-nz-25/).

There’ll also be food, drinks, and plenty of time to network with fellow attendees!
