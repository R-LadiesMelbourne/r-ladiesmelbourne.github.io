Her work has primarily focused on epigenetics and transcriptomics data analysis and methods development projects, with a particular influence in the field of methylation array analysis. More recently, she has begun working on approaches for methylation sequencing analysis with a particular focus on cancer. Jovana currently holds an NHMRC EL2 Investigator Fellowship and is leading the computational analysis for the development of a globally-accessible cell “atlas” of the healthy paediatric airway, which is funded by a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Paediatric Cell Atlas Network Grant. She is also funded by a Peter MacCallum Foundation Grant to pilot an approach for detecting known cancer fusion transcripts in single cells by adapting a novel single-cell technology.\n\n**Ask me about**:\n\n1.
