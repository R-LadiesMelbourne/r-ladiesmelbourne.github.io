<p>Do you have trouble keeping track of changes in your code? Have you ever had to collaborate on a project with others and had to send files back and forth tediously? Git will be your best friend to solve these problems and many more!</p>
<p>This presentation will give you an introduction to Git, the basics of how to use it, and some of its very helpful applications such as collaboration and code reproducibility. The focus will be on the use of Git in conjunction with Github (yes, these are two separate things!). This will help you to effectively use one of the most powerful tools available to you and give you more confidence to code freely without fear.</p>
<p>There‚Äôll also be food, drinks, and plenty of time to network with fellow attendees!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-event">About the Event</h2>
<p>Major advances in sequencing technologies, bioinformatics pipelines, and data analysis tools have transformed our ability to study malaria transmission and parasite evolution, providing valuable insights into malaria epidemiology from parasite genomic data. However, translating this genomic data into actionable insights for national malaria control programs remains a challenge. Many existing tools lack standardized workflows, comprehensive documentation, or interoperability, making it difficult for researchers and decision-makers to extract meaningful information.</p>
<p>To address this, Shazia and her team developed PGEforge (https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge), a centralized, open-access repository for malaria genomic data analysis including analysis workflows, software evaluations, and reproducible tutorials. The Plasmodium Genomic Epidemiology (PlasmoGenEpi) network convened 18 experts to assess existing analysis tools, define key use cases for genomic data, and establish objective criteria for software evaluation. This initiative identified 40 Plasmodium genomic analysis tools with 22 prioritized for evaluation, defined eight key use cases for genomic data, and developed user-friendly reproducible tutorials for ten tools using shared datasets‚Äîall now accessible via PGEforge. Open-access platforms like PGEforge can empower researchers to adopt standardized practices and can help bridge the gap between genomic data generation, downstream analysis, and the effective use of these tools for malaria molecular surveillance towards actionable information for control programs.</p>
<p>In this talk, Shazia will showcase the functionalities of PGEforge, including real-world applications of genomic data use cases and analysis workflows, our approach to reproducible tutorials, and how we built this community-driven resource at a hackathon event using Quarto!</p>

<section id="about-the-speaker" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker</h2>
<p>Dr Shazia Ruybal-Pes√°ntez is a genomic epidemiologist specializing in pathogen genomic epidemiology and its applications in malaria surveillance. Her research integrates population genetics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology to design analytical and statistical methods that enhance our understanding of malaria transmission dynamics. She is particularly interested in leveraging genomic data to optimize malaria surveillance strategies in response to emerging challenges such as increased localized outbreaks, drug resistance, and climate change. Through her work she aims to bridge the gap between data generation, analysis and real-world impact. She is also an avid R user (she is a former R-Ladies Melbourne president!) and is passionate about open science, training and capacity-building, and the development of accessible digital tools. She is also a consultant and instructor for Applied Epi, where she teaches applied epidemiologists and public health professionals to apply epidemiological methods using R.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-event">About the Event:</h3>
<p>How do we spark curiosity in coding, data science, and epidemiology among high school students? For the last several years, R-Ladies Melbourne has been running an engaging and interactive 80-minute workshop at the It Takes A Spark STEM Education Conference, introducing students to R, data visualisation, the power of clear science communication and concepts in epidemiology.</p>
<p>In this talk, Dionne will share insights from our experience delivering this workshop‚Äîhow we designed it, the challenges we navigated, and the impact we‚Äôve seen. We‚Äôll also discuss key lessons learned, how we‚Äôve adapted our approach, and our vision for the future of inspiring young minds in STEM.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre an educator, mentor, or simply passionate about making STEM more accessible, join us to explore how we can continue to empower the next generation of data scientists and communicators.</p>
<p>See you there, R-Ladies Melbourne üíú</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker:</h3>
<p>Dionne is a molecular epidemiologist and population geneticist currently positioned at WEHI (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Dionne‚Äôs avid interest in genetics, evolution and coding led her to apply these approaches to studies of infectious diseases, such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria in her Masters of Science and PhD, to P. vivax malaria and various microbes in her current first post-doc position. The research topics of interest include drug or antimicrobial resistance, spatiotemporal trends, epidemiological statistics, statistical modelling and machine learning techniques, data wrangling and visualisation. Her work has involved international collaborations in West Africa, North America and Southeast Asia, as well as supervision and support of students, with various opportunities for knowledge exchange and capacity-building in coding and genetic epidemiology. Being an active member of the R-Ladies Melbourne community, and the current President, has led to the development of practical content (workshops and the website) and has motivated her to learn and develop new techniques.</p>
