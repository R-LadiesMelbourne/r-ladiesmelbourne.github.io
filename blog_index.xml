<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-event">About the Event</h2>
<p>Major advances in sequencing technologies, bioinformatics pipelines, and data analysis tools have transformed our ability to study malaria transmission and parasite evolution, providing valuable insights into malaria epidemiology from parasite genomic data. However, translating this genomic data into actionable insights for national malaria control programs remains a challenge. Many existing tools lack standardized workflows, comprehensive documentation, or interoperability, making it difficult for researchers and decision-makers to extract meaningful information.</p>
<p>To address this, Shazia and her team developed PGEforge (https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge), a centralized, open-access repository for malaria genomic data analysis including analysis workflows, software evaluations, and reproducible tutorials. The Plasmodium Genomic Epidemiology (PlasmoGenEpi) network convened 18 experts to assess existing analysis tools, define key use cases for genomic data, and establish objective criteria for software evaluation. This initiative identified 40 Plasmodium genomic analysis tools with 22 prioritized for evaluation, defined eight key use cases for genomic data, and developed user-friendly reproducible tutorials for ten tools using shared datasets‚Äîall now accessible via PGEforge. Open-access platforms like PGEforge can empower researchers to adopt standardized practices and can help bridge the gap between genomic data generation, downstream analysis, and the effective use of these tools for malaria molecular surveillance towards actionable information for control programs.</p>
<p>In this talk, Shazia will showcase the functionalities of PGEforge, including real-world applications of genomic data use cases and analysis workflows, our approach to reproducible tutorials, and how we built this community-driven resource at a hackathon event using Quarto!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker</h2>
<p>Dr Shazia Ruybal-Pes√°ntez is a genomic epidemiologist specializing in pathogen genomic epidemiology and its applications in malaria surveillance. Her research integrates population genetics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology to design analytical and statistical methods that enhance our understanding of malaria transmission dynamics. She is particularly interested in leveraging genomic data to optimize malaria surveillance strategies in response to emerging challenges such as increased localized outbreaks, drug resistance, and climate change. Through her work she aims to bridge the gap between data generation, analysis and real-world impact. She is also an avid R user (she is a former R-Ladies Melbourne president!) and is passionate about open science, training and capacity-building, and the development of accessible digital tools. She is also a consultant and instructor for Applied Epi, where she teaches applied epidemiologists and public health professionals to apply epidemiological methods using R.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>R-Ladies Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney are thrilled to host our first ever cross-chapter TidyTuesday and we would love to have you come along!</p>
<p>TidyTuesday is a weekly event created by the Data Science Learning Community for folks to develop new skills in a low-stakes, welcoming environment. Each week, a new dataset is released for everyone to play and explore. There is no limit to what you can do! You can produce a nice-looking table, or a story-telling graphic, perhaps even an intuitive Shiny interface ‚Äì the choice is yours!</p>

<p>Join a follow-along group or work independently on the same dataset for about 30 mins then come together to celebrate each other‚Äôs creations!</p>
<p>Come join us for a fun session on coding with R and Rstudio! This event is online only. All you need is your laptop!</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-event">About the Event:</h3>
<p>How do we spark curiosity in coding, data science, and epidemiology among high school students? For the last several years, R-Ladies Melbourne has been running an engaging and interactive 80-minute workshop at the It Takes A Spark STEM Education Conference, introducing students to R, data visualisation, the power of clear science communication and concepts in epidemiology.</p>
<p>In this talk, Dionne will share insights from our experience delivering this workshop‚Äîhow we designed it, the challenges we navigated, and the impact we‚Äôve seen. We‚Äôll also discuss key lessons learned, how we‚Äôve adapted our approach, and our vision for the future of inspiring young minds in STEM.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre an educator, mentor, or simply passionate about making STEM more accessible, join us to explore how we can continue to empower the next generation of data scientists and communicators.</p>
<p>See you there, R-Ladies Melbourne üíú</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker:</h3>
<p>Dionne is a molecular epidemiologist and population geneticist currently positioned at WEHI (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Dionne‚Äôs avid interest in genetics, evolution and coding led her to apply these approaches to studies of infectious diseases, such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria in her Masters of Science and PhD, to P. vivax malaria and various microbes in her current first post-doc position. The research topics of interest include drug or antimicrobial resistance, spatiotemporal trends, epidemiological statistics, statistical modelling and machine learning techniques, data wrangling and visualisation. Her work has involved international collaborations in West Africa, North America and Southeast Asia, as well as supervision and support of students, with various opportunities for knowledge exchange and capacity-building in coding and genetic epidemiology. Being an active member of the R-Ladies Melbourne community, and the current President, has led to the development of practical content (workshops and the website) and has motivated her to learn and develop new techniques.</p>

<p>R-Ladies Melbourne is very excited to announce our next meetup event. We will be welcoming two data analytics experts, Elisa Koch and Lauren Boothby, who both work at the Australian Football League and will be joining us to discuss Leveraging the Power of Data in Sport.</p>
<p>Elisa has worked as a Data &amp; Analytics leader in the US and Australia in industries spanning finance, FMCG, technology, and sport. Currently, she is the Head of Data and Analytics at the Australian Football League (AFL). She is passionate about leading businesses to be more data driven at all levels of the business. Elisa is a people-first leader passionate about building high-performing teams built on diverse thinking and the ability to bring our authentic selves to work. Elisa serves as an Advisory Board Member for the Institute of Analytic Professionals Australia and is on the board of Spectrum Migrant Resource Centre, a non-profit focused on enabling people with migrant and refugee backgrounds to feel at home in Australia.</p>
<p>Lauren is a Senior Data Analyst and joined the Data and Analytics team at the AFL in 2023 from North Melbourne where she spent over five years working in both the football department and strategy team as a data analyst. Previous to this, Lauren has experience working with the West Coast Fever Netball Team and the West Coast Eagles Football Club.</p>
<p>Please join us on Wednesday 20th November 2024 at Dius Offices Melbourne from 5.30pm. We will first have a casual networking catch-up with some light refreshments, and the presentation will start at 6pm. You will also be able to join this event online if you are not able to join us in person.
