**Biography**: I am an applied statistician specialising in the development of statistical models for time-dependent, compositional, and spatial data. My research focuses on creating models that effectively analyse these complex datasets. Previously, I developed statistical indicators using family planning and agronomic data. My expertise lies in Bayesian modelling techniques, which leverage hierarchical structures to facilitate information exchange across populations, quantify parameter uncertainty, and integrate prior knowledge into statistical frameworks. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. My work here involves developing a method for approximate forecast reconciliation for bounded and non-gaussian data. I completed my PhD at Maynooth University under the supervision of Prof. Niamh Cahill, supported by the SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science. During this time, I also led an undergraduate statistics module at Trinity College Dublin and tutored undergraduate and postgraduate statistics courses, both online and in person. In addition to my academic experience, I have an extensive background in teaching mathematics. For eight years, I tutored second-level mathematics to Junior and Leaving Certificate students at both higher and ordinary levels. I have also earned a Professional Certificate in Teaching and Learning from Maynooth University. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as an analyst in the Data Analytics Department at EY Dublin.

**Ask me about**:

1.  Compositional data
2.  Working with Imposter Syndrome
3.  Public speaking
4.  Teaching
5.  Bayesian analysis
6.  Being an applied statistician

**Fun Facts**:

I love horseriding, going to the gym and reality TV. I am a Real Housewives/Below Deck junkie.

And yes - she uses R in her teaching and research :)

**Ask me about**:

1.  My recent experience on the academic job market
2.  How I got into statistics and data science education research
3.  Moving abroad - the career and cultural transition
4.  Anything else you’re curious about!

**Fun Facts**:

-   I prefer iced beverages over hot beverages, regardless of the temperature outside.
-   I enjoy knitting (…and using the `knitr` package).
-   I look forward to exploring more of Melbourne and would love recommendations of things to do.

**Biography**: Dr Mun Hua Tan is a scientist and bioinformatician in infectious disease research at the University of Melbourne. Trained in wet-lab science in the United States, she taught herself bioinformatics and has followed a non-linear career path, shaped by curiosity and a love of learning across disciplines. She has worked in industry and genomics centres in Malaysia and Australia, gaining experience across biodiversity, ecology, and malaria. Her research focuses on understanding the diversity of malaria parasites in natural populations, studying how they change after malaria control efforts, and improving diagnostics. After more than a decade in academic research, she recently joined the Centre for Pathogen Genomics, contributing to bioinformatics training and capacity building for public health teams across the Asia-Pacific region.

**Ask me about**:

1.  Transitioning from wet-lab to coding & bioinformatics.
2.  Navigating major career changes and pivots.
3.  What life in academic research is like.

**Fun Facts**:

1.  I'm from Malaysia and always on the hunt for new food spots
2.  A tropical soul in Melbourne, you will find me in my puff jacket most of the year
3.  I'm on a mission to grow a citrus plant on my low-sunlight apartment balcony (tips welcome!)
