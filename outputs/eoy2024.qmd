**Biography**: Kate Saunders is a lecturer in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Her primary focus is on statistical modelling of climate extremes; and understanding how the probability of extreme events might be influenced by natural variability and climate change. Other interests include; statistical post-processing of meteorological forecasts, quality control of meteorological data and how to estimate the risk posed by compound weather events. Kateâ€™s research improves our understanding of the probability of extreme weather and climate events, and helps us to make informed decisions about natural disaster risk.
