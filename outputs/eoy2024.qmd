**Biography**: Dr. Jovana Maksimovic is a Senior Research Associate in bioinformatics and computational biology in the Oshlack Lab at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Her work has primarily focused on epigenetics and transcriptomics data analysis and methods development projects, with a particular influence in the field of methylation array analysis. More recently, she has begun working on approaches for methylation sequencing analysis with a particular focus on cancer. Jovana currently holds an NHMRC EL2 Investigator Fellowship and is leading the computational analysis for the development of a globally-accessible cell ‚Äúatlas‚Äù of the healthy paediatric airway, which is funded by a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Paediatric Cell Atlas Network Grant. She is also funded by a Peter MacCallum Foundation Grant to pilot an approach for detecting known cancer fusion transcripts in single cells by adapting a novel single-cell technology.

**Biography**: Dr McCann completed her PhD in 2020 at La Trobe University which focussed on using genomics to understand the relationships of filarial nematodes, assemble a genome and develop an animal model to study a filarial disease. Throughout her Honours and PhD, she gained experience in field work, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Dr McCann has always been fascinated with the interplay between host, vector, and parasites, with this interest she applied for a job at Deakin University in malaria to use population genomics to understand how drug resistance has affected parasite population structure and lots more. Dr McCann is very involved in using bioinformatics to answer various research questions, with a strong passion for R programming and dedication to optimising pipelines and workflows.

**Ask me about**:

1. Happy to answer questions about anything.
2. The path from PhD to PostDoc
3. How I learned R programming
4. Tips and tricks about getting confident with R and bioinformatics, and helpful courses online. 

**Fun Facts**:

- I have two golden retrievers (Loki and Rylie). 
- I have a passion for dog training, hiking and outdoor adventures.

**Biography**: Kate Saunders is a lecturer in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. Her primary focus is on statistical modelling of climate extremes; and understanding how the probability of extreme events might be influenced by natural variability and climate change. Other interests include; statistical post-processing of meteorological forecasts, quality control of meteorological data and how to estimate the risk posed by compound weather events. Kate‚Äôs research improves our understanding of the probability of extreme weather and climate events, and helps us to make informed decisions about natural disaster risk.

1.  As me about silly things I've done in R.
2.  Ask me about learning to code for the first time.
3.  Ask me about my love of weather data.
4.  Ask me about natural hazards data visualisation.

**Fun Facts**:

-   I had a dog and she is the absolute cutest.
-   I love to play basketball.
