**What do you use R for?** I use R for data processing, modelling, analysis, visualisation, reports and generating websites.

**Favourite R packages**: [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [poppr](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr/)

**Biography**: Dionne is a molecular epidemiologist and population geneticist currently positioned at WEHI (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Dionne's avid interest in genetics, evolution and coding led her to apply these approaches to studies of infectious diseases, such as *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria in her Masters of Science and PhD, to *P. vivax* malaria and various microbes in her current first post-doc position. The research topics of interest include drug or antimicrobial resistance, spatiotemporal trends, epidemiological statistics, statistical modelling and machine learning techniques, data wrangling and visualisation. Her work has involved international collaborations in West Africa and North America, as well as supervision and support of students, with various opportunities for knowledge exchange and capacity-building in coding and genetic epidemiology. Being an active member of the R-Ladies Melbourne community, and the current President, has led to the development of practical content (workshops and the website) and has motivated her to learn and develop new techniques.

**Favourite R packages**: [CytofRUV](https://github.com/mtrussart/CytofRUV)

**Biography**: I am a senior post-doctoral researcher in the Bioinformatics department at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. I analyze clinical data from cancer patients receiving different drugs and develop computational methods to better predict an adapted treatment for each patient.

I am particularly concerned by the low rate of female participation in STEM and STEM careers. I have participated through different organizations such as the RLadies as a vice-president, WISPP to organize development workshops and events to empower women scientists for successful leadership among STEM professions. I am also really enthusiastic about career coaching and founded Kintsugi Coaching to address the barriers and enablers behind the participation and leadership of women in science.
