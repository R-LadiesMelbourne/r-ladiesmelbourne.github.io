This is a hands-on session to work with some Australian weather station data. So get your R set up ready! You can find the slides here and can clone the repository from github.\nAustralia weather data have a spatial component given by the station coordinates and a temporal component that provides daily measures of precipitation, and maximum/ minimum temperature. We will use the package sf to work on the spatial side to generate some maps (bonus point if) and the package tsibble to conduct some exploratory data analysis on the temporal side. One way to communicate space and time information together is through a glyph map where temporal coordinates are transformed into space. We will create the glyph map with the ggplot geom: geom_glyph(). Lastly, we will experiment with a new data structure, cubble, to arrange spatio-temporal data."

This enables users to customise and integrate new graphical elements with existing ggplot2 visualisations, resulting in a broad range of informative graphics. The idea is to illustrate it with a few examples, but mainly demonstrate it through the recently developed R package gghdr. The package provides a framework for visualising Highest Density Regions (HDR) using the ggplot2 graphics syntax. The method of summarizing a distribution using HDR is useful for plotting multimodal distributions, but unlike box plots, density plots, or violin plots, there is no way to draw HDRs in a ggplot2 framework. We will see how gghdr extends the functionality of ggplot2 by calling new stat_* and geom_* functions, where the stat_* functions are inherited from the R package hdrcde and the geom_* functions are built to produce the new plotting symbols."

Because they tell us a different story from the norm. An anomaly or an event might signify a failing heart rate of a patient, a fraudulent credit card activity, or an early indication of a tsunami. As such, it is extremely important to detect anomalies or anomalous events. In this talk, we will give an introduction to anomaly detection. Anomalies are rare events. As a result, standard accuracy measures do not apply. But then, how do we evaluate an Anomaly Detection (AD) method? If we want to compare two or more AD methods, what kind of simple tests can we do? What are the data repositories that are available for AD? We will also discuss an ensemble method for AD. Constructing an AD ensemble is challenging because the class labels are not known. We will look at an unusual ally from psychometrics – Item Response Theory – to help us in this construction."

Longitudinal cluster randomised trials follow clusters over time, and clusters may switch between treatment groups during these trials. Cross-overs, stepped wedges and staircases are all variants of these types of cluster randomised trials, and they are being conducted with increasing frequency. However, many of the underlying statistical aspects of these designs remain under-explored. I’ll discuss some of the work my group has been doing to increase our understanding of these trials and develop less burdensome trial designs, including our development of apps using the R shiny package.

She is currently working on spatial risk modelling for Buruli ulcer in Victoria, and is more broadly interested in applied Bayesian hierarchical models, forecasting, and open science.\nResearch using R underpins a wide array of applied decision-making. Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform. Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation. In this talk, I will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation."

    "text": "Random Forest, Climate Change and Food Production\n\n\n\nOur 25-10-2017 meetup with Elisabeth Vogel, a PhD student at the Australian-German Climate & Energy College at the University of Melbourne. Her research interests are centered on climate change impacts on ecological and human systems, with a particular focus on climate extreme events and agriculture.\nClimate extreme events, such as droughts or heatwaves – have a severe impact on agricultural productivity worldwide. It is important to understand how such extreme events have affected global food production in the past in order to increase the resilience of the global food system to such events in the future. In this presentation, I will talk about how random forests - a machine learning algorithm - can help to detangle the complex interactions between climate and agricultural variables. In the first part of this presentation, I will introduce the concept of random forests, how they are used for regression and classification problems and how to build random forests in R using the randomForest package. In the second part I will talk about how I applied random forests to global climate and agricultural datasets to look at how climate extreme events affected agricultural production."

She will be giving the main presentation of the evening.\nThe advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available biological data coming from different sources. Combining such large-scale data sets can lead to the discovery of important insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. During this talk, I will introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. The toolkit provides a wide range of methods to statistically integrate several data sets at once and probe relationships between heterogeneous data sets. mixOmics has been developed for ’omics biological data (hence the name!) but the methods are applicable for other analytical problems where dimension reduction and data integration are required. I will relate my R journey through the development of the package and share tips and pitfalls to avoid when developing large R packages."

We will be welcoming two data analytics experts, Elisa Koch and Lauren Boothby, who both work at the Australian Football League and will be joining us to discuss Leveraging the Power of Data in Sport.\nElisa has worked as a Data & Analytics leader in the US and Australia in industries spanning finance, FMCG, technology, and sport. Currently, she is the Head of Data and Analytics at the Australian Football League (AFL). She is passionate about leading businesses to be more data driven at all levels of the business. Elisa is a people-first leader passionate about building high-performing teams built on diverse thinking and the ability to bring our authentic selves to work. Elisa serves as an Advisory Board Member for the Institute of Analytic Professionals Australia and is on the board of Spectrum Migrant Resource Centre, a non-profit focused on enabling people with migrant and refugee backgrounds to feel at home in Australia.\nLauren is a Senior Data Analyst and joined the Data and Analytics team at the AFL in 2023 from North Melbourne where she spent over five years working in both the football department and strategy team as a data analyst. Previous to this, Lauren has experience working with the West Coast Fever Netball Team and the West Coast Eagles Football Club.\nPlease join us on Wednesday 20th November 2024 at Dius Offices Melbourne from 5.30pm. We will first have a casual networking catch-up with some light refreshments, and the presentation will start at 6pm. You will also be able to join this event online if you are not able to join us in person. Please register your attendance (both in-person and online) on Meetup by the 14th November for planning purposes.\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n💜 Caitlin on behalf of R-Ladies Melbourne\nBack to our blog home page"
