## Who we are

We are a registered non-profit organization and a local chapter of [**R-Ladies Global**](https://rladies.org/). Our aim is to promote gender diversity in the R community, both in Australia and worldwide.

As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

R-Ladies Melbourne Inc welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing.

## What we do

We host regular meet-ups, usually monthly or twice a month. We cover a range of topics from intro to advanced - for more information [**click here to see github repo with all our previous events**](https://github.com/R-LadiesMelbourne/Links-to-Events-Repos).
